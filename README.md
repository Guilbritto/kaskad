# Kaskad

Kaskad is a functional front-end library that helps you to build applications with vanilla Javascript. This library is suitable for Javascript lovers who know what they are doing!

The performance and development patterns are all up to you! However, I recommend the usage of functional principles like the ones implemented in the [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) library.

It's not the purpose of this library to compete with React, Vue, Svelte, or Angular.  You can utilize Kaskad aside these frameworks! It is transparent and works directly with DOM elements. 

The bundle size with all Kaskad dependencies is very tiny! Programming vanilla Javascript has numerous benefits like easy bundler configuration, better readability that is up to you, and total flexibility! Therefore, you can build fast front-ends with almost no dependencies with excellent build size and performance.

If you know Javascript, you know everything built with it. So make sure to understand what is happening behind the scenes! There is no going back when you have all the knowledge to create robust applications with no bloated modules and endless packages.
